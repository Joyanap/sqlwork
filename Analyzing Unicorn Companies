You have been asked to support an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. 
They are interested in understanding which industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging. 
Providing them with this information gives them a competitive insight as to industry trends and how they should structure their portfolio looking forward.

From those industries (1), 
you will need to find the number of unicorns within these industries (2), 
the year that they became a unicorn (3), 
and their average valuation, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places (4).
